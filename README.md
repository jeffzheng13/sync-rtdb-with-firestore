# sync-rtdb-with-firestore
Sync Google's Realtime Database with Firestore using NodeJS Script
1. Download Nodejs Libraries via npm (search online if you don't know how to do this)
2. Create a Nodejs Project and use the following code
3. Download the JSON Account Key for your database (Firebase and RTDB use the same so you only need one key)
4. Fill in the code where it says //[redacted]
5. Retrieved values will be in array format with objects
6. I am parsing and converting data to GeoPoint before sending, you can do whatever you want here. Explore and learn some JS.
